My Hello World tutorial project

Create side bar and navigation panel with Angular material schematic.

Cloned to macbook and try to understnad if it's a branch "book"
version.

So after committing above sentense what happened? It was committed and pushed to main (origin) branch. So, I need different. Found these commands and implemented right in console:

git branch book
git chackout book

Git saud "Switched to branch 'book'". Good. Try to commit these changes and push. Will see where they appear.
